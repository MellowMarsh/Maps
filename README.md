# Maps Fend Project
This is the final FEND project with Udacity.

## Features
This is a list of local fast food locations in the Killeen, Tx area. These locations display as markers on the map. Click a marker to see website information and location. Click on the hamburger button to see the list of Fast Food Locations.

## Setup:
* Git the clone or fork the repo:
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* I used visual studio and downloaded all the packages I needed for this project.  You can launch (Live Server Package) within   the project once the nodes are in place. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
* Or open folder in your favorite code editor and use yarn start to open map in http://localhost:3000/

Note that the default service worker is used in this app (bootstrapped with create-react-app) and so only works in production build.
