# Maps

## Overview


* Google Maps
* FourSquare
* Font Awesome 
* React Material-UI for the Drawer
* google-maps-react for primary map display

## Features
This is a list of Mcdonald's cafe in the Killeen, Tx area. These locations display as markers on the map. Click a marker to see website information and location. Click on the hamburger button to see the list of McDondald's cafe.

## Setup:
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* Open folder in your favorite code editor and use yarn start to open map in http://localhost:3000/

Note that the default service worker is used in this app (bootstrapped with create-react-app) and so only works in production build.
